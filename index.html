    <h2>Aspiring Web Developer</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Welcome! This site is a living portfolio to present my programming 
    projects as a burgeoning web developer. During this site's evolution, 
    early projects will be focused on the core web languages—<strong>HTML, 
    CSS, and JavaScript</strong>—but I will be adding projects utilizing 
    <strong>Ruby, Rails, and React</strong> in the near future. I am also 
    fluent in <strong>Python</strong>, so I expect to post some of my favorite 
    Python projects, too.</p>

    <h4>My Path to Programming</h4>
    <p>I have taken quite a journey to discover my passion for programming. 
      <span>Always having an affinity and an aptitude for &#34;computery&#34;
      things</span>—building PCs in my youth, becoming a power-user of every 
      platform and application I came across—I had simply considered this 
      interest to be a hobby. In fact, my higher education and work experience 
      are in mostly unrelated fields (interestingly, unrelated to each other, 
      as well).</p>

    <p>Pursuing, and acquiring, a Master's degree in <em>Music</em> took me to 
      New York City, where I lived and worked for almost 20 years. As a young 
      musician, I supplemented my income through work in the financial 
      services industry. Over time, I eventually found the business world to 
      be vastly more lucrative, waking up one day to realize my job had become 
      a full-fledged career. For 15 years, I worked in <strong>desktop 
      publishing</strong> and <strong>graphic design</strong> departments at 
      preeminent financial firms in NYC, starting as an entry-level 
      <em>word processor</em>, adding <em>graphic design</em> to my skills-set, 
      becoming a <em>trainer</em>, and then organically transitioning into 
      management as an <em>Operations Manager</em>, then a <em>Senior Account 
      Manager</em> being groomed for <em>Director</em>.</p>

    <p>A handful of years ago, my wife had an opportunity to relocate to 
      Portland, OR, through her employer. This was an interesting moment to 
      reassess our lives (some might call it the proverbial mid-life crisis!) 
      and, even though it meant me leaving a long and successful career, we 
      decided to make the move—packing up everything and moving 3,000 miles 
      across the country. The move afforded me the opportunity to evaluate 
      where to take the next half of my life. It also gave me a lot of time to 
      pursue personal interests, the majority of which naturally revolve 
      around technology. Given the deep, deep ocean that is technology, I 
      found myself studying and hopping from one topic to the 
      next—command-line computing, networking, UNIX, Linux (already being well 
      acquainted with Windows and macOS), Ethical Hacking, and eventually 
      programming.</p>

    <p>One of many ethical hacking courses I took introduced me to the Python 
      programming language, using it to write our own custom tools. This was 
      my first experience with programming and I was so enthralled with it 
      that I spent the entire next year becoming fluent in Python and  
      devouring any material I could on associated programming concepts. 
      Surprisingly, it wasn't until late in this process of self-education 
      that <span>I realized this, THIS, is how I want to spend the rest of my 
      professional life!</span> So, I am presently immersed in a 6-month 
      bootcamp at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com" title="The most 
      collaborative code school on- and offline"><strong>Epicodus</strong></a> 
      code school and I'm elated to be stepping into the wonderful world of 
      software development.</p>

    <h4>My Other Interests, Hobbies, and Skills</h4>
    <p>When I'm not computing, I like to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Play my guitar, ukulele, and banjo</li>
      <li>Watch '60s-era Hammer Horror movies</li>
      <li>Read</li>
      <li>Brew beer</li>
      <li>Hike</li>
      <li>Travel the globe</li>
    </ul>
