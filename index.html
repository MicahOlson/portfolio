  <h2>Aspiring Web Developer</h2>
  <p>Welcome! This site is a living portfolio to share my programming projects as a burgeoning web developer. During this site's evolution, early projects will be focused on the core web languages—<strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>—but I will be adding projects utilizing <strong>Ruby, Rails, and React</strong> in the near future. I am also fluent in <strong>Python</strong>, so I expect to post some of my favorite Python projects, too.</p>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I have taken quite a journey to discover my passion for programming. Always having an affinity and an aptitude for &#34;computery&#34; things—building PCs in my youth, becoming a power-user of every platform and application I came across—I had just considered it a hobby. In fact, my higher education is in a mostly unrelated field, <em>Music</em>.</p>
  
  <p>Persuing, and acquiring, a Master's degree took me to New York City, where I lived and worked for almost 20 years. As a young musician, I supplimented my income through work in the financial services industry. Over time, I eventually found this field to be significantly more lucrative, waking up one day to realize it had become a full-fledged career. For 15 years I worked in <em>desktop publishing</em> and <em>graphic design</em> departments at preiminent financial firms in NYC, starting as an entry-level word processor, adding graphic design, becoming a trainer, and then ulimately an operations manager.</p>
