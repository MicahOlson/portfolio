  <h2>Aspiring Web Developer</h2>
  <p>Welcome! This site is a living portfolio to share my programming projects as a burgeoning web developer. During this site's evolution, early projects will be focused on the core web languages—<strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>—but I will be adding projects utilizing <strong>Ruby, Rails, and React</strong> in the near future. I am also fluent in <strong>Python</strong>, so I expect to post some of my favorite Python projects, too.</p>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I have taken quite a journey to discover my passion for programming. Always having an affinity and an aptitude for &#34;computery&#34; things—building PCs in my youth, becoming a power-user of every platform and application I came across—I had simply considered this a hobby. In fact, my higher education and work experience are in a mostly unrelated fields (interestingly, unrelated from each other, as well).</p>
  
  <p>Persuing, and acquiring, a Master's degree in <em>Music</em> took me to New York City, where I lived and worked for almost 20 years. As a young musician, I supplimented my income through work in the financial services industry. Over time, I eventually found the business world to be vastly more lucrative, waking up one day to realize it had become a full-fledged career. For 15 years, I worked in <em>desktop publishing</em> and <em>graphic design</em> departments at preiminent financial firms in NYC, starting as an entry-level word processor, adding graphic design to my skills-set, becoming a trainer, and then ulimately into a management track as an <em>Operations Manager</em>, then a <em>Senior Account Manager</em> quickly on my way to <em>Director</em>.</p>

  <p>Then one day, my wife had an opportunity to relocate to Portland, OR, through her employer. This was an interesting moment to reassess our lives (some might call it the proverbial mid-life crisis!) and, even though it meant leaving a long and successful career, we decided to make the move—packing up everything and moving 3,000 miles across the country.</p>
