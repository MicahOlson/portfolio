    <h2>Aspiring Web Developer</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Welcome! This site is a living portfolio to share my programming projects as a burgeoning web developer. During
    this site's evolution, early projects will be focused on the core web languages—<strong>HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript</strong>—but I will be adding projects utilizing <strong>Ruby, Rails, and React</strong> in the near
    future. I am also fluent in <strong>Python</strong>, so I expect to post some of my favorite Python projects, too.
  </p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <h4>My Path to Programming</h4>
    <p>I have taken quite a journey to discover my passion for programming. Always having an affinity and an aptitude
      for &#34;computery&#34; things—building PCs in my youth, becoming a power-user of every platform and application I
      came across—I had simply considered this a hobby. In fact, my higher education and work experience are in mostly
      unrelated fields (interestingly, unrelated to each other, as well).</p>

    <p>Pursuing, and acquiring, a Master's degree in <em>Music</em> took me to New York City, where I lived and worked
      for almost 20 years. As a young opera singer, I supplemented my income through work in the financial services
      industry. Over time, I eventually found the business world to be vastly more lucrative, waking up one day to
      realize my job had become a full-fledged career. For 15 years, I worked in <em>desktop publishing</em> and
      <em>graphic design</em> departments at preeminent financial firms in NYC, starting as an entry-level word
      processor, adding graphic design to my skills-set, becoming a trainer, and then ultimately into a management track
      as an <em>Operations Manager</em>, then a <em>Senior Account Manager</em> on my way to <em>Director</em>.
    </p>

    <p>Then one day, my wife had an opportunity to relocate to Portland, OR, through her employer. This was an
      interesting moment to reassess our lives (some might call it the proverbial mid-life crisis!) and, even though it
      meant me leaving a long and successful career, we decided to make the move—packing up everything and moving 3,000
      miles across the country. The move afforded me the opportunity to evaluate where to take the next half of my life.
      It also gave me a lot of time to pursue personal interests, the majority of which organically revolve around
      technology. Given the deep, deep ocean that is technology, I found myself studying and hopping from one topic to
      the next—command-line computing, networking, UNIX, Linux (already being well acquainted with Windows and macOS),
      Ethical Hacking, and eventually programming.</p>

    <p>One of many ethical hacking courses I took introduced me to the Python programming language, having us write our
      own custom tools. This was my first experience with programming and I was so enthralled with it that I spent the
      entire next year becoming fluent in Python and associated programming concepts. Surprisingly, it wasn't until late
      in this process that I realized this, THIS, is how I want to spend the rest of my professional life—programming!
    </p>

    <h4>My Other Interests, Hobbies, and Skills</h4>
    <p>When I'm not computing, I like to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Play my guitar, ukulele, or banjo</li>
      <li>Watch '60s-era Hammer Horror movies</li>
      <li>Read (sci-fi mostly)</li>
      <li>Brew beer</li>
      <li>Hike</li>
    </ul>
